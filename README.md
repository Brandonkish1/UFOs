#### Using a filter
To filter the data for specific information enter text into the text bars on the left of the web page. The data in the table will be fitlered to reflect your search parameters. In the example below a filter is being used for the date 1/9/2010.

## Summary
One drawback of the this design is the user doesn't know what all the search options are. They could spend a lot of time searching for things that aren't part of the data set.

On solution could be to put some text under under each search bar giving an idea what the search options could be. Alternativly it might be better to change each search bar to a drop down menu to ensure you are only making searches within the scope of the data set.
